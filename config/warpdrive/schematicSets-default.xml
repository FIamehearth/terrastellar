	<!--
	  A schematicSet is a list of possible schematics.
	  loot.item is the registry name of the item. It's mandatory.
	  loot.damage is the damage level, also known as metadata. It defaults to 0.
	  loot.nbt is the NBT data in JSON format converted to XML. Here's a site to do the XML conversion part: http://coderstoolbox.net/string/#!encoding=xml&action=encode&charset=utf_8
	  loot.minQuantity is self explanatory. It defaults to 1.
	  loot.maxQuantity needs to be higher than loot.minQuantity to have any effect. It defaults to 1.
	  
	  Here after is an example with NBT data.
	<loot item="warpdrive:item_ship_token" damage="5" nbt="{shipName:&quot;MySchematicName&quot;}" />
	  
	  When used on machines, we'll give a few trials to find a valid slot for each loot, eventually try another loot, eventually skipping it altogether.
